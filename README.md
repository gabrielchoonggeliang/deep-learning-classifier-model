# AlexNet Object Classifier

This repository contains an object classifier based on the AlexNet architecture for image recognition.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to train a model capable of classifying different types of objects based on images. Initially, the model will focus on distinguishing between four common categories.

## Installation

To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:gabrielchoonggeliang/deep-learning-classifier-model.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd deep-learning-classifier-model
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the object classifier, follow these steps:

1. Train the model using the your own dataset.
2. Evaluate the model's performance using test data.
3. Use the trained model to classify new images.

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the classifier by modifying the configuration files located in the `config/` directory.
