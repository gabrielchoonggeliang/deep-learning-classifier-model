# AlexNet Car Brand Classifier 
The aim of this project is to train a AlexNet model that could classify car brands. The current plan about this project is to differentiate between four common car brands that is local to where I am, namely: **Proton, Perodua, Toyota and Honda.**

I am working on training the neural network at the moment but I am planning to expand the capability of this network in the future.

## Project Overview
This project uses the AlexNet model for training. The dataset was collected manually by capturing car photos of various angles. A number of approximately 900 photos were collected by hand.
